            JS Modules can only be loaded from a web server, so if you are merely opening the HTML file in your browser directly from your filesystem then the module file wonâ€™t load. The Live Server VSCode extension provides a web server for you so that you can run your HTML page through it and thus be able to load a module. 

            Modules are treated differently than regular JS script files by the browser and thus you need to tell the browser that the file you are including is a module and not a regular JS script file.
